##### General information
This project was my first attept of creating a game using Unity Engine. It was made by a two-person team as a uniwersity project. The roles were not strictly assigned however I was responsible mostly for the technical issues such as game mechanics whereas my teammate worked mostly with the visual issues. The Game contains two levels - to pass each of them the player have to kill 10 enemies. By default player can use W A S D keys to control the character, mouse to aim and left click to shot.
